Test methodology:

1. RTT Time
    RTT = OS overhead (TCP/IP protocol Stack) - NIC overhead - network overhead(ignored) - NIC overhead - OS overhead
    
    3 methods:
    1. TCP connection step. SYN -> ACK SYN -> ACK 
    2. TCP send and recv
    3. UDP send and recv
    4. ICMP send and recv

    delete the first time. (ARP request).

    OS overhead.
	127.0.0.1
	go through network

2. Bandwidth
    Parallel way option

    TCP / UDP/
    Different size of packet. MTU. 
    
    TCP load line (TODO: libpcap)


    RAW (TODO:) libpcap ? raw_socket if you like.
